Data processing for Milestone 1

## Overview
Explore the relationships of varied insulin prices in different regions and on diabetes patient outcomes in the same regions.

## Data Pipeline Overview
All the data acquisition and processing steps will be managed via separate "make" targets.  A simple "make all" command will take care of all data management, from download to cleaning, to processing.

## Naming conventions
All notebooks for EDA will be prefixed "EDA_" so their purpose is clear.  For deeper analysis notebooks, the prefix is still to be determined.
